1. The function is defined in the following file:
File:       /usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py
Definition: os.path.abspath(path)
Docstring:  Return an absolute path.

2. num = ! ls /etc | wc -l
232 files in the directory

3. use a = float(num.n) to transfer the string into a float. a**0.5 = 15.23

4. use %timeit to calculate the time. The fastest is x*x, which uses 163 ns on my laptop.

5. use %magic. There are 24 cell magics.
